## Voice / NLP

- **Semantic episode search via voice** — commands like "play any stories about Claude or Anthropic" that query episode titles/descriptions using keyword or embedding-based search, then auto-play the best match. Requires: episode description indexing in Room, a search ranking function, and new `VoiceCommand.SEARCH` handler in `VoiceCommandHandler`.

## Haptics

- **Haptics preference** — expose a setting to disable haptic feedback on snap mode activation in `ChapterProgressBar`. (Noted in progress bar design doc `docs/plans/2026-06-03-progress-bar-design.md`.)

## Phase 2

- **Always-on wake word** — Picovoice Porcupine or Vosk integration for hands-free activation without tapping the mic FAB.
